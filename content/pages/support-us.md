      ### I need your help!


      As pretty much a one-man team, I (Jason) have spent years of personal time
      and effort developing LingoMap and do not yet have a way to make money. I
      work a day job like you probably do and am paying for the hosting of this
      app out of my own pocket!


      Please buy me a cup of coffee if you find LingoMap helpful! Then I can
      keep coding late into the night to make sure LingoMap keeps working for
      you!


      Currently I can accept WeChat Pay donations in RMB from China-based WeChat
      accounts.


      How to donate:


      ##### 1. Skip this step if you're already in WeChat. If not, then:


      Option 1: Use your web browser's share function to send the link to this
      page to a chat in WeChat and then click on it.


      Option 2: Copy this page's URL, paste it in a chat in WeChat, and then
      click on it.


      ##### 2. Long-press this QR code and select Scan QR Code.
