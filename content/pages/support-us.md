As pretty much a one-man team, I (Jason) have spent years of personal time and effort developing LingoMap and do not yet have a way to make money. I work a day job like you probably do and am paying for the hosting of this app out of my own pocket!

Please buy me a cup of coffee if you find LingoMap helpful! Then I can keep coding late into the night to make sure LingoMap keeps working for you! Your help is greatly appreciated!

Currently I can accept WeChat Pay donations in RMB from China-based WeChat accounts.

How to donate:

1\. Open this webpage in WeChat if you're not there already:

*   Option 1: Use your web browser's share function to send the link to this page to a chat in WeChat.

*   Option 2: Copy/paste this page's URL and send it to yourself in WeChat using the File Transfer chat tool.

2\. Long-press this QR code and select Scan QR Code.
