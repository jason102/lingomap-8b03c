As pretty much a one-man team, I (Jason) have spent years of personal time and effort developing LingoMap and do not yet have a way to make money. I work a day job like you probably do and am paying for the hosting of this app out of my own pocket!

Please buy me a cup of coffee if you find LingoMap helpful! Then I can keep coding late into the night to make sure LingoMap keeps working for you! Your help is greatly appreciated!
